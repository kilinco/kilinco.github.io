Wilkommen. Bienvenue. Welcome. I am fresh out of the Machine Learning and Data Science Master's program at UCSD. I joined the [ACES Laboratory](http://aceslab.org/) in August 2018, where I focused on decentralized machine learning - I ended up writing my thesis on this topic. I'm waiting  for life to start right now, if it hasn't already. Since I mostly love what I do, I've never had a job I hated. I am trying to find something I hate doing. Blogging might be one of them. I shall see. 

Did I mention that I love machine learning? I had always been interested in nature and science as a kid. In high school, I became subtly interested in consciousness and perception. Then in college I became gradually more interested in machine learning (it wasn't such a hot topic at the time). This interest flowered at UCSD - thankfully, I had found myself at the right place at the right time. These days I am more interested in things like decentralized machine learning, federated learning, continual learning, bayesian neural networks, variational inference, uncertainty and model calibration, explainability... The list goes on, since I find myself fascinated by a lot of new things. 

### Other than machine learning

I like learning and, to be honest, I haven't had much time to do anything else but survive in grad school for the last two years. As a free man now, I want to get back into making some music. Here is a link to my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/achillestendon) account. 

Another interest of mine is sustainability. One low-key project I have at the moment is building a vertical farm to grow veggies at home. Lastly, my 2019-2020 goal is to learn how to invest for financial sustainability (don't ask why). Soo.. I am mostly reading books like "The Intelligent Investor" and "A Random Walk on Wall Street".
