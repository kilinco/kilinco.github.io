Wilkommen. Bienvenue. Welcome. I am a software engineer building robust data and logging infrastructure for autonomous vehicles. My work focuses on creating reliable systems that collect, process, and analyze data. I am deeply interested in autonomous systems and the infrastructure that powers them.

### Professional Highlights
*   Built a pipeline for handling process crashes and coredumps.
*   Developed software to collect and index data from vehicle and operations.
*   Created diagnostics and tooling to address on-vehicle data storage issues.
*   Daemonized on-vehicle logging for continuous data capture.
*   Built metadata processing tools and dashboards for observability.
*   Built CLIs and GUI sub-components for daily logging operations.
*   Designed systems for logging operations in remote environments with limited internet access.
*   Developed the communication interface, hardware abstraction, control logic and diagnostics components for the EUV light source.

### Interests
My professional work is deeply connected to my long-standing interests in machine learning and robotics. I'm fascinated by the entire stack that makes intelligent systems possible, from low-level data collection to computer vision. In the past I have focused on areas such as decentralized and federated learning, continual learning, model calibration and explainability. Today I build scalable infrastructure to support autonomous vehicles. 

### Other than machine learning
I hike, read books and watch movies. Here and there I also take online courses to learn things that I am interested in. 

Books and movies are an indispensable part of my life. Although they are never up-to-date, you could check out my [Letterboxd](https://boxd.it/7ifyn) and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122558299-osman-cihan-kilinc) accounts, if you want to see what I have been upto. Here is a link to my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/achillestendon) account as well. I love books where history, economics, finance, statistics and probability are interwoven. Perhaps some day I will write a post on this topic.

Fun fact: I used to play bass guitar in an 80s cover band in high school. We mostly played hard-rock.
