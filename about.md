Wilkommen. Bienvenue. Welcome. 
I am a software engineer at ASML, supplying semiconductor industry with the brightest light of all times. 

I was fresh out of the Machine Learning and Data Science Master's program at UCSD, when I joined ASML. I worked at [ACES Laboratory](http://aceslab.org/) from August 2018 to June 2019, where I focused on decentralized machine learning. I ended up writing my Master's thesis on this topic. When I started this blog, I was waiting for life to start but [the pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) hit. And I'm still waiting. 

Since I mostly love what I do, I've never had a job I hated. I am trying to find something I hate doing. Blogging might be one of them. I shall see. 
[2021 Update] Blogging turned out to be ok, but persistence is tricky. 

Did I mention that I love machine learning? I had always been interested in nature and science as a kid. In high school, I became subtly interested in consciousness and perception. Then in college I became gradually more interested in machine learning (it wasn't such a hot topic at the time). This interest flowered at UCSD - thankfully, I had found myself at the right place at the right time. These days I am more interested in things like decentralized machine learning, federated learning, continual learning, bayesian neural networks, variational inference, uncertainty and model calibration, explainability... The list goes on, since I find myself fascinated by a lot of new things.

### Other than machine learning

I make music, read books and watch films. Here and there I also take online courses to learn things that I am interested in. 

Books and films are an indispensable part of my life. You could check out my [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22343877) and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122558299-osman-cihan-kilinc) accounts, if you want to see what I have been upto. Here is a link to my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/achillestendon) account as well. 

Since 2019, I have been reading a lot of finance-related books from "Intelligent Investor" to "Antifragile". I am always trying to educate myself in finance/investing. I had always been interested in it, but I never actually had the time or money to do anything. 

Lastly, another interest of mine is sustainability. One low-key project I have at the moment is building a vertical farm to grow veggies at home.
