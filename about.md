Hi, I'm Cihan. I'm currently doing my M.S. in Machine Learning and Data Science at UCSD. In August 2018, I joined the ACES Lab., where I'm focusing on Machine Learning for mobile devices. My most recent project is on decentralized machine learning. I hope to write a few posts on it in the future.

### Other than machine learning

I love making and listening to music. Here is a link to my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/achillestendon) account.
