This is my first post. It is just a draft. Currently, I'm working on decentralized machine learning and exploring new ways to transfer learning between machines. <!--more--> It's definitely not going to cause a machine uprising and we won't live in a robot-ruled post-apocalyptic world. But as we live by our devices, die by our devices, and in an economy where all data is kept at the hands of the few, it is of incredible importance to keep some autonomy, whilst staying in touch with technology. For example, machine translation is a wonderful thing, but to achieve that companies are collecting a lot of data from us and their services are never ever really free. Wouldn't it be wonderful, if we could come together, collectively train a model and make it open source, so that everyone could use it? I'm trying to develop a framework to achieve this. I'm optimistic.
