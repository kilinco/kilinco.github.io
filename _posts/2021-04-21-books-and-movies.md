Why does one have an urge to share what they are reading or watching? Is it a [synchronization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-_VPRCtiUg) effort? I have no idea.<!--more-->

I started keeping a list of books and movies that I have watched in December 2020. I decided to share these lists with the world. I am not entirely sure what my objectives are for doing that, so I might remove them later. Perhaps someone will see the book list and reach out. Maybe I will respond to them. Maybe it will help drive some insightful discussions. Maybe it's the geek in me. Maybe I'm following [Bill Gates' footsteps](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books). Maybe I am trying to promote the books/movies that I like. Who knows?! For now, they are under [/books](https://kilinco.github.io/books/) and [/movies](https://kilinco.github.io/movies/). I will try to keep them up-to-date (if I don't remove them). I won't try to be a reviewer, but I might also share my notes about the culture that I am consuming. This would not be limited to books and movies, but also to music, events, art shows etc. (when/if pandemic is over).
