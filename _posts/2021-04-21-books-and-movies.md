A watchlist can be used to track the movie and TV shows you want to watch. A reading list can be used to track the books you want to read. Some people even sort their lists in some order. But why does one have an urge to share them? Is this a form of [synchronization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-_VPRCtiUg)? This strong urge certainly helped grow IMDb and Goodreads, where you can share your lists amongst many other things. <!--more-->

I had long wanted to keep track of the movies I watch and the books that I read. They are an indispensable part of my life. They can be a window to the past, and perhaps the future. Therefore, in the midst of the pandemic, I started keeping a list for the books that I read and a list for the movies that I watched. I decided to share them with the world. I am not entirely sure what my motive is. Perhaps someone will see the book list and reach out. Maybe I will respond to them. Maybe it will help drive some insightful discussions. Maybe it's the geek in me. Maybe I'm following [Bill Gates' footsteps](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books). Maybe I am trying to promote the books/movies that I like. Who knows?! For now, they are under [/books](https://kilinco.github.io/books/) and [/movies](https://kilinco.github.io/movies/).
